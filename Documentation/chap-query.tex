\chapter{Querying the environment}

\label{chap-environment-querying}

In this chapter, we describe classes and functions that are used by
the language processor to query the environment concerning information about
program elements that the language processor needs in order to determine how to
process those program elements.

When the language processor calls a generic query function, it passes two or
three arguments, depending on the function it calls.  The first
argument is called the \texttt{client}.  \sysname{} does not
specialize on this argument, but client code should define a standard
class and pass an instance of that class for this argument.  Client
code can then define auxiliary methods that specialize to this class
on the query generic functions.  The second argument is the
environment concerned by the query.  Client code must supply methods
on these functions, specialized to its particular representation of
its global environments.  If the client does not have an explicit
representation of its global environment (as is usually the case), it
must nevertheless define a dummy standard class to specialize on.
Contrary to global environments, \sysname{} provides its own
representation of \emph{lexical} environments, and it provides methods
on the query functions, specialized to the classes defined to
represent those lexical environments.  Client code that wants
to use a different representation of lexical environments than the one
provided by \sysname{} must also provide methods specialized to its
lexical environment classes.

The primary methods on the query functions should return instances of
the classes described in this chapter.  Any such instance contains all
available information about some program element in that particular
environment.  This information must typically be assembled from
different parts of the environment.  For that reason, client code
typically creates a new instance whenever a query function is called,
rather than attempting to store such instances in the environment.  If
any of these client-supplied methods fails to accomplish its task, it
should return \texttt{nil}.

Client code is free to define subclasses of the classes described
here, for instance in order to represent implementation-specific
information about the program elements.  Client code would then
typically also provide auxiliary methods or overriding primary methods
on the compilation functions that handle these classes.
