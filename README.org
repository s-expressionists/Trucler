#+TITLE: Trucler

This library defines a CLOS-based protocol to be used by Common Lisp
compilers for environment query and update.  In addition, library authors
can use the =trucler-native= interface to inspect native environments.

* Examples
** Introspection at Macroexpansion Time
The following macro can be used to ensure the presence of a local symbol
macro, and to see whether it has the expected expansion:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defmacro assert-local-symbol-macro-description
    (name &key (expansion nil expansion-p) &environment env)
  (let ((description (trucler:describe-variable *client* env name)))
    (check-type description trucler:local-symbol-macro-description)
    (when expansion-p
      (assert (equal expansion (trucler:expansion description))))
    `(values)))
#+END_SRC

** Introspection at Runtime
Trucler can also be used to inspect the runtime environment - here with an
example of querying the state of the variable =*print-array*=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(trucler:describe-variable
 (make-instance 'trucler-native:client)
 nil
 '*print-array*)
; => #<trucler-native-sbcl::global-special-variable-description {100A7E5A23}>
#+END_SRC

* Related Work
Trucler can be seen as a modern, extensible version of the protocol
desicribed in section 8.5 of the second edition of Guy Steele's book [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node102.html#SECTION001250000000000000000][Common
